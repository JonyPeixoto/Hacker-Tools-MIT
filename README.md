# About the project

https://jonypeixoto.com

Hacking Tips and Tools is a repository to show as many summarized experiences as possible about hacking the full stack web and mobile application built and organized by [Jony Peixoto](https://jonypeixoto.com "Site de Jony Peixoto").

The application consists of a search by Google and externally to other networks such as the Deep Web and associates about the hacking world, where data is collected in operating systems: Windows, Linux, mainly in applications of internal tools of the Linux system.

# How to run the project

## Windows or Linux
Pr√©-requisitos: Must have a device that runs the Linux operating system or using Windows prompt.

<br/>

![Windows prompt](https://github.com/jonypeixoto/jonypeixoto/blob/main/assets/prompt-windows.png)

<br/>

## Linux:

Similarly, follow the same 3 steps above, open the terminal on Linux, especially on Kali Linux (shown in the screenshot below), you can choose between user mode or root mode (it works in the same way as running it as administrator on Windows).

Preferably, choose root mode to have all administrator privileges and be able to use all commands in the operating system.

![Kali Linux](https://github.com/jonypeixoto/jonypeixoto/blob/main/assets/terminals-kali-linux.png)

Observation:

In user mode, "$" appears before every command you will type.

In root mode, "#" appears before every command you will type.
