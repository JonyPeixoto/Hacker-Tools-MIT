Hacking Tips and Tools is a repository to show as many summarized experiences as possible about hacking the full stack web and mobile application built and organized by [Jony Peixoto](https://jonypeixoto.com "Portfolio de Jony Peixoto").

The application consists of a search by Google and externally to other networks such as the Deep Web and associates about the hacking world, where data is collected in operating systems: Windows, Linux, mainly in applications of internal tools of the Linux system.

## :warning: Prerequisites

To use and test the presented tips and tools, you must have correctly installed and licensed the operating systems or similar mentioned below.

## :information_source: How To Use

## Windows or Linux
Pr√©-requisitos: Must have a device that runs the Linux operating system or using Windows prompt.

## Windows:

```bash
1) Open the search bar (Windows button) on your keyboard

2) Type prompt and run as administrator

3) Ready, now type the desired commands !
```

<br/>

![Windows prompt](https://github.com/jonypeixoto/jonypeixoto/blob/main/assets/prompt-windows.png)

<br/>

## Linux:

Similarly, follow the same 3 steps above, open the terminal on Linux, especially on Kali Linux (shown in the screenshot below), you can choose between user mode or root mode (it works in the same way as running it as administrator on Windows).

Preferably, choose root mode to have all administrator privileges and be able to use all commands in the operating system.

![Kali Linux](https://github.com/jonypeixoto/jonypeixoto/blob/main/assets/terminals-kali-linux.png)

Observation:

In user mode, "$" appears before every command you will type.

In root mode, "#" appears before every command you will type.

## Commands on the Linux:

## Basic Linux Navigation Commands:

```bash
  Bottom TAB help to auto-complete any name in yout prompt on the Ubuntu Linux

# Historical about the files on the Linux directory
$ ls  

# Open the file
$ cd (name file) 

# Comeback 1 file
$ cd .. 

# Create a file
$ mkdir

# Clear the prompt command
$ clear 

# Show all the historical commands used on the promt command
$ history 

# Restart the machine (PC, Notebook, etc)
$ reboot

# Turn off the machine (PC, Notebook, etc)
$ shutdown 

# Delete the file (name file)
$ rm -rf (name file)

# shows / types the last commands typed in the Prompt
$ CTRL + p 
```

## Linux Commands:

```bash
# Updates only what is needed on Ubuntu Linux (security, etc)
$ apt-get update 

# Update everything on Ubuntu Linux
$ apt-get upgrade

# Remove what it is not necessary on Ubuntu Linux
$ apt-get autoremove 

# Install the (program name)
$ apt-get install (program name) 
```

### Section 1: OVERVIEW GOOGLE HACKING

* What is Google Hacking / Dorking?

Google hacking, also named Google dorking, is a hacker technique that uses Google Search and other Google applications to find security holes in the configuration and computer code that websites are using.

Google Hacking = Google Dorking = OSINT = Open Source Intelligence


* What is Open Source Intelligence? How is it used?

OSINT = Open Source Intelligence = is derived from data and information that is available to the general public.

It's not limited to what we find using Google, although the so-called SOPHIES Web is an important component.


* History

The concept of Google hacking dates back to 2002 when Johnny began to collect Google search queries that uncovered vulnerable systems and sensitive information discloses labeling them as Google Docs.

The list of Google Docs grew in a large dictionary of queries, which were eventually organized in the original Google hacking database that is G.H. DBE in 2004.

Sometimes Google hacking referred to as Google talking, have been extended to other search engines such as Bing and Shodan.

Automated attaack tools use custom search dictionaries to find vulnerable systems and sensitive information disclosures in public systems that have been indexed by search engines.


* Exploring its Techniques & Benefits

What is important understand?

Advanced Google searches used to find security loopholes on websites and allow hackers to break in to or disrupt the site. Google hacking is a computer hacking technique that uses Google Search and other Google applcations to find security holes in the configuration and computer code that websites use.

It's not hacking into Google servers!

It's just using Google search techniques to find exactly what we actually need.

* Benefits

Benefits of Google dorks(Hacking):

Displays better attractive search results .

Easy to learn.

Shows hidden tricks and links as well.

# SECTION 2: ABOUT GOOGLE SEARCH
* How Google Works?
* What are Crawlers?
* How do They Work?
* How Search Engine Works?
* What are Keywords?
* Recap


### SECTION 2: ABOUT GOOGLE SEARCH

* How Google Works?

1) Query

3) Google Web Server

3) Index Servers: The web server send the query to the index servers. The content inside the index servers is similar to the index in the back of a book--it tells which pages contain the words that match any particular query term.

4) Doc Servers: the query travels to the doc servers, which actually retrieve the stored documents. Snippets are generated to describe each search result.

5) Google user: the search results are returned to the user in a fraction of a second. 


* What are Crawlers? How do They Work?

1) Search engine
2) Crawler
3) mywebsite.com
4) Website Contents
5) Dictionary of content such as keywords & images is recorded by the Crawler
6) Keywords: Apple, Banana, Pear
7) The Crawler sends these keywords to the Search Engine to be stored for later search

* How Search Engine Works? What are Keywords?

A user submits a query to search...

1) User searches for "Pears"
2) Search Engine indexes all crawled websites that has the keyword "Pears"
3) anotherwebsite.com
4) Website Contents
5) Keywords: Apples, Bananas, Pears
